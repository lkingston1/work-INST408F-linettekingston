# Introduction

Here we aim to study: Does whether someone has gotten a flu shot/spray in the past year depend on their residence in an urban or rural county, race, or the number of times theyâ€™ve visited a health professional in the past year?

# Data Cleaning

Independent Variable(s)

  DRVISITS (continuous)
  x.urbstat (categorical)
  x.race (categorical)
  
Dependent Variable

### Interpreting Slope Coefficients

A 1 unit increase in the number of times an individual has visited a health professional in the past year causes the log odds of one having received a flu shot/spray in the past year to increase by 0.016753, holding the other independent variables constant. 

The log odds of having gotten a flu shot/spray in the past year between those who live in a rural county and those who live in an urban county is 0.062636, holding the other independent variables constant.

The log odds of having gotten a flu shot/spray in the past year between those who are Black only, Non-Hispanic and those who are White only, Non-Hispanic is -0.435257, holding the other independent variables constant.

The log odds of having gotten a flu shot/spray in the past year between those who are American Indian or Alaskan Native only, Non-Hispanic and those who are White only, Non-Hispanic is -0.198222, holding the other independent variables constant.

The log odds of having gotten a flu shot/spray in the past year in the past year between those who are Asian only, Non-Hispanic and those who are White only, Non-Hispanic is  -0.130982, holding the other independent variables constant.

The log odds of having gotten a flu shot/spray in the past year between those who are Native Hawaiian or other Pacific only only, Non-Hispanic and those who are White only, Non-Hispanic is -0.712910, holding the other independent variables constant.

The log odds of having gotten a flu shot/spray in the past year between those who are multiracial, Non-Hispanic and those who are White only, Non-Hispanic is -0.673452, holding the other independent variables constant.

The log odds of having gotten a flu shot/spray in the past year between those who are Hispanic and those who are White only, Non-Hispanic is -0.412961, holding the other independent variables constant.


### Interpreting P-values

Since the p-value for "the number of times an individual has visited a health professional in the past year" (2e-16) is less than alpha, 0.05, we can conclude that the number of times an individual has visited a health professional in the past year is associated with whether or not an individual got a flu shot or spray in the past year.

Since the p-value for "rural counties" (0.00989) is less than alpha, 0.05, we can conclude that residence in a rural county is associated with whether or not an individual got a flu shot or spray in the past year.

Since the p-value for "Black only, Non-Hispanic" (<2e-16) is less than alpha, 0.05, we can conclude that whether someone is Black, non-Hispanic is associated with whether or not they got a flu shot or spray in the past year.

Since the p-value for "American Indian or Alaskan Native only, Non-Hispanic" (0.00296) is less than alpha, 0.05, we can conclude that whether someone is Black, non-Hispanic is associated with whether or not they got a flu shot or spray in the past year.

Since the p-value for "Asian only, Non-Hispanic" (0.20160) is less than alpha, 0.05, we can conclude that whether someone is Black, non-Hispanic is not associated with whether or not they got a flu shot or spray in the past year.

Since the p-value for "Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander only, Non-Hispanic" (0.01613) is less than alpha, 0.05, we can conclude that whether someone is Black, non-Hispanic is associated with whether or not they got a flu shot or spray in the past year.

Since the p-value for "Multiracial, Non-Hispanic" (3.38e-15) is less than alpha, 0.05, we can conclude that whether someone is Black, non-Hispanic is associated with whether or not they got a flu shot or spray in the past year.

Since the p-value for "Hispanic" (<2e-16) is less than alpha, 0.05, we can conclude that whether someone is Black, non-Hispanic is associated with whether or not they got a flu shot or spray in the past year.
